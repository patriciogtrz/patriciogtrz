# Welcome

**Psychiatry Resident | Neuroscience and Cognitive Research | Computational Psychiatry | Health Technology Development | Python Enthusiast**

---

I am a second-year psychiatry resident in Monterrey, Mexico. My professional focus lies in the integration of neuroscience, computational methods, and clinical psychiatry to advance the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of mental disorders. I aim to bridge clinical practice with technology-driven solutions to enable scalable and evidence-based interventions.
